# How smart is your home?
Building AI course: final project.
## Summary
An app / web page to quantify (through the information entered by the user), the home automation level of your home and the best solutions to increase it. 
## Background
As a big fan of technology and Italian, I would like my country to become a more modern country by helping people like me, with an already strong interest in tech to make their homes smart.

Through a smart home, people will be able to live safer and save time and energy also thanks to the use of renewable energy.

In Italy in 2018, according to the Internet of Things Observatory of the Politecnico di Milano, the market for tech accessories for smart homes reached a value of 380 million euros, with a growth of more than 50% compared to the previous year. Therefore, the Italian smart home market is growing at a rapid pace, with rates among the highest in Europe. However, from the point of view of absolute value, there is still a long way to go. In fact, in Germany the market is worth 1.8 billion, in the United Kingdom 1.7 and in France more than 800 million euros. Therefore, there is still ample room for the growth of a market that we can define as young, albeit not embryonic.

The smart home market in Italy is growing at a dizzying pace. To reinforce this assumption there are also other data relating to the population. For example, about 60% of Italians have heard of a connected home and almost 1 in 2 people have a smart device (most have a security device, such as IP cameras or motion sensors). In addition, the market is moving more and more towards “do it yourself” solutions. In fact, although the market share relating to installers and home automation professionals still maintains a preponderant role, it has gone from a market share of 70% in 2017 to 50% in 2018. Therefore, both online and offline retailers have experienced a significant increase in sales, especially of smart speakers.
## How is it used?
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account
## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
