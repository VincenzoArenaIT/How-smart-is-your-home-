# How smart is your home?
Building AI course: final project.
## Summary
An app / web page to quantify (through the information entered by the user), the home automation level of your home and the best solutions to increase it. 
## Background
As a big fan of technology and Italian, I would like my country to become a more modern country by helping people like me, with an already strong interest in tech to make their homes smart.

Through a smart home, people will be able to live safer and save time and energy also thanks to the use of renewable energy.

In Italy in 2018, according to the Internet of Things Observatory of the Politecnico di Milano, the market for tech accessories for smart homes reached a value of 380 million euros, with a growth of more than 50% compared to the previous year. Therefore, the Italian smart home market is growing at a rapid pace, with rates among the highest in Europe. However, from the point of view of absolute value, there is still a long way to go. In fact, in Germany the market is worth 1.8 billion, in the United Kingdom 1.7 and in France more than 800 million euros. Therefore, there is still ample room for the growth of a market that we can define as young, albeit not embryonic.

The smart home market in Italy is growing at a dizzying pace. To reinforce this assumption there are also other data relating to the population. For example, about 60% of Italians have heard of a connected home and almost 1 in 2 people have a smart device (most have a security device, such as IP cameras or motion sensors). In addition, the market is moving more and more towards “do it yourself” solutions. In fact, although the market share relating to installers and home automation professionals still maintains a preponderant role, it has gone from a market share of 70% in 2017 to 50% in 2018. Therefore, both online and offline retailers have experienced a significant increase in sales, especially of smart speakers.
## How is it used?
Through the information provided by users, a score will be given on how smart your home is and suggestions will be given on how to increase this rating by highlighting what is missing and what is present, thus recommending the best tech solutions to increase energy efficiency and the home automation of your home according to your needs and financial resources, in fact through filters it will be possible to set the minimum or maximum budget that you are willing to spend.

Through an online price comparator, the tech solutions with the best quality / price ratio will be suggested and you will receive advice on how to install them or who to contact to do it.
## Data sources and AI methods
The type of AI is a simple Narrow AI that through the data provided elaborates a score.

The score value will be devised by the project developers based on the importance of the smart implementation in the home.
## Challenges
This tool could have difficulty in reaching the less digitized groups of citizens with the risk of being a help tool for people already passionate about technology.

Furthermore, considering the fact that those who would use this app / web site, should make changes in their home that often to reach the highest score, (in the home automation level), will require a not insignificant outlay of money, it could be limiting from this point of view.

Not to forget the risk of entrusting the safety and well-being of ourselves and of our family entirely to technology and the related cybersecurity related problems that could occur.
## What next?
 The next step could be the foundation of a company that deals with installing tech solutions in homes, based on the software previously developed for the app / website of this project.
